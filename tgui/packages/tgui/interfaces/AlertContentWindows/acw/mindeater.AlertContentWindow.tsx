        1. You start off intangible and can choose to become tangible once at a
        location you pick. You get 3 lives, and will revert to an intangible
        state upon death.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Your goal is to gain Intellect from crew members! Use your ability
        Brain Drain to do so, which will award you with Intellect. Stealth and
        your Disguise ability will help you.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. You cloak while in darkness. Being in light for too long, attacking,
        or using most abilities will reveal you. A visibility indicator next to
        you shows if you are visible or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Your basic attack is a ranged attack that slows down those hit and
        prevents them from running. It drains chemicals, replacing them with
        toxins.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Start attacks by sneakily draining brain from crew members. When they
        become aware of you, use your ranged attack to slow them down. Use
        Project and Spatial Swap for evation as needed. Use Project, Spatial
        Swap, Paralyze, and Cosmic Light to gain asa much Intellect as you can.
        Finish off the attack with by using Pierce the Veil on the target.
